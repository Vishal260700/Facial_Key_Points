# Facial Key Points detection

# Data

1.   IDLookUpTable.csv
2.   Training.csv - Its has coordinates of facial keypoints like left eye, rigth eye etc and also the image.
3.   Test.csv - Its has image only and we have to give coordinates of various facial keypoints by looking at IDLookUpTable.csv

# Conclusion - 

1.   The model is based on keras lib with Dense layers
2.   The model, worked quite well on images in the shape we defiened.
